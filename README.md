# Features
 - Online CV with minor responsiveness
 - Printable as A4 PDF
 - HTML5 + CSS3
 - Customizeable colors

## Print your PDF CV
When printing the page in the browser, you'll get a formatted A4 page that can be used as your PDF resume.
If your page holds more than 1 A4 page, the content will be divided into the given amount of pages.

For better formatting, you can set the number of pages in the `config.toml` file.

If badges and other elements with background don't render correctly, remember to toggle the "Background Graphics" option in the print dialog.
